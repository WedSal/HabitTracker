Habit Tracker is a user-friendly habit tracker app designed to help you 
maintain and master your daily habits. Developed as a school project using SwiftUI and Core Data, 
this app offers a simple yet effective way to keep track of your progress.

The app opens with a home screen, where a button takes you to the main habit management page. 
Here, you can easily add new habits by entering their names, track your daily progress by marking habits as completed, 
and see how many days in a row you've maintained your streaks. ðŸ”¥ If you no longer need a habit, you can easily delete it.
